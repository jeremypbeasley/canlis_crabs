- title: Social Distancing
  desc: This entirely outdoor restaurant has been specifically built to accommodate
    a minimum of six feet between seated guests. Our team will go out of their way
    to give you space and we will greatly minimize the number of staff serving any
    given table.
- title: Masks
  desc: Will be worn by our staff at all times. Guests without masks will not be allowed
    into the restaurant and must wear them when not seated at the table. Gloves will
    be worn by our staff whenever handling food, drinks, and plates and are changed
    frequently.
- title: Temperatures <img class="emoji" src="/uploads/ball.gif"/>
  desc: Are taken and logged daily for all staff members. Guests will also be temp-checked
    before entry to the Crab Shack. No guests with a temperature over 100.4F will
    be admitted, nor anyone in their party. The reservation will be cancelled and
    the entire party fully refunded.
- title: Handwashing
  desc: Sinks are provided for guests both inside and outside of restrooms. Crab shack
    staff are required to frequently wash their hands during shifts. <img class="emoji"
    src="/uploads/wash.gif"/>
- title: Sanitation
  desc: All tables have built-in hand sanitizer pumps and are wrapped in polyurethane
    to enable the highest level of cleaning between seatings.
- title: 'Smiling <span class="color-white" style="font-size: 1.5em">☺</span>'
  desc: 100% authorized and at times absolutely necessary to maintain sanity and remind
    each other that we’re all in this together.
